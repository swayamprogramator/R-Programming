#Data Structures in R

#Vectors

#element of vectors are known as component
#length()-tells us no. of element in vector
#two types of vector-atomic vector and list

#creating atomic vector
a<-c(3,4,5,6,1,2)
a
b<-3:10
b
c<-seq(1,10,by=3)
c
d<-seq(1,10,length.out = 8) #give evenly spread sequence of length 8
